        I am web developer with experience building fast, functional websites to
        boost lead generation as well as helping customers achieve a larger web
        presence. Technologies like Reactjs, AdobeXD, and Visual Studio Code are
        my go-tos for building, designing, and coding. Recently my focus has
        been on Next.js and TailwindCSS for reliably building fast, responsive,
        mobile friendly, and easily scalable websites.
