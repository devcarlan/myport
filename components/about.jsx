        About Me
      </h3>
      <p className='text-md mt-2 leading-8'>
        Web development/coding was always in my future. I grew up using
        computers and from a young age knew that I would make a career doing
        something in the budding online space we now know as the internet. As a
        web developer I love hearing the excitement in a client's voice when
        they are able to view their website online for the first time. It always
        makes the late nights and extra hours put in worth it. As a person I
        strive to maintain a high standard of quality in all things I do and
        development is no exception. My web dev journy started with me making
        simple single page sites using HTML and CSS on the family computer.
        After graduating from college, I was introduced to Wordpress at my first
        place of employment. After leaving, in my search for more light-weight
        web technologies I came across React. I fell in love immediatiely and
        began to consume as much information as I could about the framework.
        Currently, I'm learning/using technologies like Next.js, Strapi, and
        TailwindCSS.
