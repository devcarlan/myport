        I am a web developer with experience building fast, functional websites
        to boost lead generation as well as gaining a larger web presence.
        Technologies like Reactjs, AdobeXD, and Visual Studio Code are my go-tos
        for building, designing, and coding. Recently my focus has been on
        Next.js and Tailwind CSS for reliably building fast, responsive, mobile
        friendly, and easily scalable websites.
